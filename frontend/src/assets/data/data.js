      title: "Instagram launches a new broadcast chat feature called ‘Channels’",
      content: "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced today that the company is launching a new broadcast chat feature on Instagram called “Channels.” The feature lets creators share public, one-to-many messages to directly engage with their followers. Channels support text, images, polls, reactions and more. Zuckerberg announced the feature by starting his own broadcast channel, where he plans to share Meta updates going forward."+
      "\nInstagram is starting to test channels with a select creators in the U.S. today, and plans to expand the feature in coming months. Creators can use broadcast channels to help followers stay updated and see behind-the-scenes moments. Instagram notes that only creators can post in broadcast channels, and that followers only have the ability to react to content and participate in polls."+
      "\nIn the coming months, Instagram plans to add more features to broadcast channels, such as the ability to bring another creator into the channel to discuss upcoming collabs and collect questions for an AMA via question prompts."+
      "\nThe new feature gives creators a new way to update their followers within the app. In the past, creators have usually posted a story to share news and updates with their followers, but they now have the option to use a more direct way to engage with their fans. The feature also lets creators get feedback on certain things and promote their content."+
      "\nAlthough Meta is debuting channels on Instagram first, the company plans to bring the feature to Messenger and Facebook in the coming months, according to Zuckerberg."+
      "\nOnce a creator gets access to channels, they can start one from their Instagram inbox. After sending their first message, their followers will receive a one-time notification to join the channel. When the channel is live, creators can also encourage their followers to join by using the “join channel” sticker in Stories. Creators will soon be able to pin their channel to their profile."+
      "\nAll users on the social network can discover broadcast channels and view the content, but only followers who join the channel will receive notifications when the creator posts updates. Followers can leave or mute broadcast channels at any time and can also control their notifications from creators.",

      title: "More brands are now testing TikTok’s Shop feature in the US",
      content: "TikTok is continuing its push toward making its app a shopping destination by onboarding more brands for its Shop initiative, which lets companies sell their goods directly on the app with a full checkout experience. TikTok began testing Shop in the U.S. this past November, and we now know a few more brands that are part of this initial testing phase."+
      "\nAccording to a report from Ad Age, companies including apparel brands like PacSun, Revolve and Willow Boutique as well as beauty brand KimChi Chic are now part of this shopping experiment. Users who want to shop these brands’ products can tap on the shopping bag icon on the brand’s profile to view their catalogs and complete the checkout process without leaving TikTok’s app."+
      "\nThe company confirmed to TechCrunch that TikTok Shop in the U.S. is “still in the testing phase,” as it has been since November, but didn’t provide any information about the timeline for a wider launch."+
      "\nAlthough users have been able to purchase products through ads on TikTok for quite some time now, they were previously taken to an in-app browser to make their purchase. With TikTok Shop, the checkout process takes place directly within the app, which makes the experience feel more native and seamless. This is also how Instagram Shop works."+
      "\nOutside the U.S., TikTok Shop has been available in select markets, including Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore, for nearly a year. Prior reports indicated that TikTok had dropped plans to bring Shop to the U.S. and additional parts of Europe after the venture reportedly struggled to gain traction in the U.K. However, TikTok seems to believe there is a market for Shop in the U.S. given these ongoing tests."+
      "\nBeyond TikTok Shop, the company has been investing in other shopping features as well. Last March, the app teamed up with Instacart to let food creators make shoppable lists linked to recipe videos. Later in June, it started testing a dedicated shopping feed, which served as a hub for products being sold in TikTok Shop, also in select markets. In addition, it experimented with live shopping in different markets such as the U.K. and several countries in Southeast Asia."+
      "\nAs TikTok continues to work on shopping features, its competitor apps are scaling back on some of their e-commerce efforts. Instagram removed the shop tab in January and announced this month that it is dropping the live shopping efforts. Facebook also shut down its live shopping feature in August 2022. Amazon, meanwhile, experimented with live shopping in various markets. Plus, YouTube last May introduced new live shopping features like allowing two creators to stream together."+
      "\nHowever, there is little evidence that these experiments are working to drive significant amounts of online commerce in Western markets as they have in Asia. Reports suggested that in the U.S., social commerce accounts for just 5% of e-commerce sales."+
      "\nThat could be because of cultural differences in how apps are used between markets. But it’s also difficult to track all the shopping conversions that come from being influenced to buy a product in a social space. Some of those e-commerce transactions may not take place immediately using the direct links shared by a brand or creator, in fact. But the video content or brand’s ad may serve to drive a sale at a later date after the consumer sees more digital ads or seeks out the product themselves through a search on Google or Amazon, or through a visit to the retailer’s website."+
      "\nThe phrase “TikTok made me buy it,” has become popular, however, for the video app’s ability to drive impulse sales. The term now has 7.4 billion views on TikTok, in fact, and the hashtag has 42.6 billion. In-app shopping features could not only drive more of those sales, it could make them trackable for brands and businesses, as well.",

      title: "Here are the features coming to iOS 16.4",
      content: "Apple released the first developer beta of iOS 16.4 on Thursday and while this update is designed for a small base of users, the iPhone-maker has given us a glimpse of the features to expect when the stable version of iOS 16.4 is seeded. The features include new emojis, an updated podcasts app and notification support for web apps."+
      "\nEmojis are pretty important and we are getting 31 of them with iOS 16.4. The first draft of these emojis — including a moose, a goose, a pink heart and “I am shook” — was released last year. Now, with Apple’s latest software update, they will soon come to iOS devices. As Thursday’s release is a developer beta, there might still be some design modifications to these emojis in the final release."+
      "\nApple’s Podcasts app is also getting updated with new features in the iOS 16.4 update. Notably, if you have subscribed to channels through the podcasts app, they will show up in a new “Channels” section in your library. With iOS 16.4, users will be able easily to resume shows on the move by accessing the browse section in CarPlay mode. The app updates will also ship to Podcasts’ iPad and macOS apps through the upcoming iPadOS 16.4 and macOS 13.3 releases."+
      "\nThe Up Next queue in the Podcasts app will display unfinished show episodes — even if you don’t follow that particular podcast. To remove them from the queue you either have to manually delete them from there or mark them as played."+
      "\nApple’s iOS 16.4 update also brings good news for website push notification fans. If a user has added a web app to the home screen, developers will be able to send a push notification after asking for permission. The company first showed this feature at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) last year. Safari 16.1 update allowed W3C standards-based “Web Push” mechanism to macOS Ventura."+
      "\nIn the WebKit blog, Apple said users can now also add web apps to the home screens from third-party browsers. Until now, they could only do this through Safari."+
      "\nThere are some small but notable upgrades that are coming with iOS 16.4. First, the Messages app now supports a rich preview of Mastodon links, so you will be able to see more details about the post. The software update is also adding support for T-Mobile’s 5G standalone service for better speeds. What’s more, users will be able to set the Always On screen on or off with a Focus filter."+
      "\nYou can download the iOS 16.4 beta through a developer profile or wait for the public beta version to drop to test it out.",

      title: "Relationship app Flamme, previously Sparks, rebrands and adds new AI tool",
      content: "Relationship app Flamme, previously known as Sparks, has launched its rebranded app and introduced a new AI-powered Ask Me Anything tool in time for Valentine’s Day. Although there are numerous dating apps on the market, there aren’t many apps that aim to keep the spark alive after you enter a relationship. Flamme is catered toward existing couples looking to introduce new and fun experiences to their lives, and also improve communication in their relationship."+
      "\nThe app, which initially launched while the company was exhibiting at Battlefield 200 at TechCrunch Disrupt last October, has been rebranded with a new interface. Flamme CEO Ankit Nayal told TechCrunch that the redesigned app incorporates feedback received from beta users and is easier to use than the original app."+
      "\n“With our launch at Disrupt last year and the community feedback, we were able to understand the user preferences, and problems, a lot better,” Nayal told TechCrunch. “We integrated those into our current product and expanded the range of tools available to strengthen relationships. Now apart from just helping couples have a fun time, we help improve their communication as well.”"+
      "\nNayal and his team created Flamme with the goal of addressing some common challenges faced by couples, communication and busy schedules. It can be difficult for partners to find time for each other and maintain intimacy and fun, so Flamme aims to provide a platform for couples to strengthen their relationship and stay connected."+
      "\nThe company has added a new AI-powered “Ask Me Anything” tool that lets users ask questions about relationships. For instance, you can ask about popular date locations in New York City. Or, you can ask about unique ways to propose to your partner. The company tested the tool on the web for the past few months and is now bringing it to its mobile app."+
      "\nThe launch of the new feature comes as AI has become an increasingly trending topic over the past few months, especially due to the launch of ChatGPT. Nayal told TechCrunch that he sees AI playing a bigger role in shaping the app’s future."+
      "\nThe app features daily discovery questions that are designed to help users learn more about their partners. Users can only see answers when both people in a relationship have answered a question. Flamme also has a date-planning feature that uses an ML-powered recommendation engine to help you plan date nights. In addition, the app includes a relationship tracker, shared bucket list, memories calendar and more."+
      "\nSome may wonder why they need an app to help stay connected with their partner. To that, Nayal says Flamme isn’t trying to replace communication between couples, it’s instead looking to make communication more efficient while helping users keep the spark alive with their partner.",

      title: "Meta is reportedly planning a fresh round of layoffs",
      content: "Meta is preparing a fresh round of job cuts, according to a report from the Financial Times. Two people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that there has been a lack of clarity around budgets and the future headcount at the company. The job cuts are expected to take place around March, but it’s unknown how people could be affected."+
      "\nThe lack of clarity has resulted in staff noting that not much work is getting done, as managers have been unable to plan ahead, the report says. Certain budgets that would normally be finalized by the end of the year still haven’t been finalized, and decisions that would usually take days to be signed off on are now taking a month in some cases."+
      "\nMeta did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment."+
      "\nThe report comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this month during an earnings call with analysts that the company plans to continue to contain costs. He promised a “year of efficiency” and said that Meta would be more proactive about cutting low-priority and low-performance roles. Zuckerberg noted that Meta would be flattening its organization structure and “removing some layers in middle management to make decisions faster.”"+
      "\nIn November, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, or about 13% of its global workforce. The cuts were the largest in Meta’s history and impacted multiple departments within the company, with recruiting and business teams affected the most. At the time, the company said its hiring freeze would extend into early 2023, with only a “small number of exceptions.”"+
      "\nAlthough Meta clearly isn’t the only company to announce layoffs in the past year, it’s one of the few to expand on its previous layoffs. For instance, Amazon originally said that it would lay off 10,000 employees, but later expanded that figure to 18,000. In addition, Coinbase recently laid off 950 employees, after already letting go of 1,100 employees last June."+
      "\nThe news comes as Meta announced today that its chief business officer, Marne Levine, is stepping down after 13 years at the company. During her time at Meta, Levine served as the first chief operating officer at Instagram and was also the vice president of global public policy at Facebook. Meta said that moving forward, Nicola Mendelsohn and Justin Osofsky will take on expanded roles as senior sales and partnership leaders and will report to COO Javier Olivan.",
